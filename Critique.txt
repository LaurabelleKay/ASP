The timetabler creates a timetable which meets the basic and extended specification, however
there are a few problems with the application. The timetabler struggles to produce a timetable for
inputs where there are more than 7 units, it either returns no answer sets, or if other parameters are
adjusted to accommodate for there being more units, the timetabler runs but gets stuck in the optimisation.
Another issue with the timetabler is that it does not accommodate 2 lecturers teaching the same unit, it
just produces a timetable in which only one lecturer takes that unit. The timetabler also doesn't have the
ability to put the student lunch weighting over the preferred lecture weighting, this also causes it to be stuck
in the optimisation.
